1. Sign up for github and email me your username(to: dsrogersjr@gmail.com) so I can add you to the list of commiters(people who can work on the project)

2. Create an SSH key for github.  You can do this through the git gui

2. Create your ruby on rails application for this course in the directory which git will be accessing.

	In my case is it C:/users/doug/mis438/mis438

C:/users/doug/mis438 is the directory git is accessing, and C:/users/doug/mis438/mis438 is the directory for the ruby on rails application.

3. Using the Git gui go to edit--> options and put your github username and email address in both the MIS438 repository and global repository fields.

4.
