Setting up git and Github for our ruby application.

I am assuming that you already have ruby on rails installed on your computer.  Also, that you have not produced any code yet.

1. Install Git on your computer by going to http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list and downloading the first file in that list.  All the default options should be fine, but make sure you install the git gui.

2. Sign up for github at https://github.com/

You will be asked to provide an SSH key when you sign up.  You can do this through the git gui by going to help-->show ssh key and generating a key. 

Note: the key is the entire block of text.

Once you have done this email me your username(to: dsrogersjr@gmail.com) so I can add you to the list of committers(people who can work on the project)

*At this point wait until I have added you as a committer.*

4. Open the git gui and click "clone existing repository" enter "git@github.com:dsrogersjr/MIS438.git"  For the target directory, browse to where you want this project to be stored on your computer.

3. Using the Git gui go to edit--> options and put your github username and email address in both the MIS438 repository and global repository fields.

This will take all the files that are currently stored on github and put them into the directory you just specified.


You should now be set up to receive all project updates.  Don't worry if all your files don't show up in the respository.  Since we haven't started writing any code, all our computers only have the defualt folders and files, so there aren't any changes we need to download.  For instance, as of now this readme file is the only file on github because I edited it and committed the changes.
