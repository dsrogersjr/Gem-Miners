Setting up git and Github for our ruby application.

1. Install Git on your computer by going to http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list and downloading the first file in that list.  All the default options should be fine, but make sure you install the git gui.

2. Create your ruby on rails application for this course in the directory which git will be accessing.

	In my case is it C:/users/doug/mis438

3. Open the git gui and click "open existing repository" and browse for the directory you just created.

4. Sign up for github at https://github.com/

You will be asked to provide an SSH key when you sign up.  You can do this through the git gui by going to help-->show ssh key and generating a key. 

Note: the key is the entire block of text.

Once you have done this email me your username(to: dsrogersjr@gmail.com) so I can add you to the list of commiters(people who can work on the project)

5. Using the Git gui go to edit--> options and put your github username and email address in both the MIS438 repository and global repository fields.

You should now be set up to receive all project updates.  Don't worry if all your files don't show up in the respository.  Since we haven't started writing any code, all our computers only have the defualt folders and files, so there aren't any changes we need to download.  For instance, as of now this readme file is the only file on github because I edited it and committed the changes.
