1. Install Git on your computer by going to http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list and downloading the first file in that list.  All the default options should be fine, but make sure you install the git gui.
 
2. Sign up for github at https://github.com/
 
3. You will be asked to provide an SSH key when you sign up.  You can do this through the git gui by going to help-->show ssh key and generating a key.
 
Note: You may have to use a dummy repository to get into the git gui, just pick a random folder (something in my documents should be fine)
Note: the key is the entire block of text.
 
4. Once you have done this email me your username(to: dsrogersjr@gmail.com) so I can add you to the list of committers(people who can work on the project)
 
5. Open the git gui and click "clone existing repository" enter "git@github.com:dsrogersjr/MIS438.git" For the target directory, browse to where you want this project to be stored on your computer. (I created an MIS438 folder in my documents)
 
6. Using the Git gui go to edit--> options and put your github username and email address in both the MIS438 repository and global repository fields.
